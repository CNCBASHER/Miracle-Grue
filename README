# Layout

This project is laid out in the following directory tree (roughly)

 - documentation/ Documentation
 - configs/ Eclipse project, personal stuff
 - src/  Source Code for the project MiracleGrue
	- json-cpp library to read/write JSON text files (configuration)
	- mgl/ the Miracle-Grue library
	- morphogen.cc the main file
	- unit_tests various test programs (using cppunit)
 - inputs/ Some stl input files for demo

miracle.config 
this is the default configuration file for Miracle-Grue. It contains information like the layer height, the nb of shells, and the infill pattern. 
When miracle-grue executes, it looks for a 'miracle.config' in the current directory, unless -c is used to specify a different config file.

Building.md
A guide to install the tools on various platforms and compile the code (using scons instead of makefiles)
