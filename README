# Miracle Grue

## Overview 
This project is the basis for a new toolpathing engine to suppliment skeinforge in the MakerBot/3D printer community.  The engine is C++ based with a python interface, for quick prototyping.

The engine is run as a series of Operations, which can receive or send DataEnvelopes.  These envelopes contain one Atom of data (ie 1 layer of an object, one toolpath section, or one entire model) and are used to pass data to and from different operations.
