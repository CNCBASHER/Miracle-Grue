#Operation
 An Operation is a single step in the data transformation.  It can take a limited list of DataEnvelope types, and emits a single DataEnvelope type as specified in config. The general workflow of an operation is to create a series of Operations, connect them together, and pass a series of DataEnvelopes through it.

Pseudocode Example:
	# Create the chain
	Config c = newConfig("output=gcode")
	Operation s = SliceOperation()
	Operation f = FillOperation()
	Operation o = OutputOperation()

	# create the chain
	s.setNextOperator(f)
	f.setNextOperator(o)
	
	# prepare for data
	s.init(c)
	f.init(c)
	o.init(c)	

	# start running the chain
	DataEnvelope e = StlEnvelope("text-ascii","some_file.stl");
	s.collect(e);	#manually call collect on the slicer.
			#each time a section of data is done, it will 
			#call collect on the fill. When each fill is done,
			#that will call collect on the output operator
		
	# since this is single threaded, when we return we know the data is done
	s.cleanup()
	f.cleanup()
	o.cleanup()
