Gcoder module output

Naturally, the output of the gcoder is gcode, specifically the following gcode flavors are supported:
- Makerbot firmware (add link to specific version and repository here).

The gcode emitted by the gcode contains annotations. Annotations are text strings embedded in gcode comments (enclosed in parantheses).

These annotations allow to:
- get a description of the command

These should be extended to provide additional information:
- track which module a section of gcode comes from
- provide visual cues for visualizers (i.e. colors and materials)
- reconstruct the configuration of the Growth (all model and config files, user settings) 

Multiple extruder support

Miracle Grue handles multiple extruders via the Gcode.
- Each extruder has an offset position relative to a center point.
- Codes that control extrusion speed and temperature use a T code that determines wich extruder gets the command 
- There is a coordinate systems for each extruder
- The coordinate system is selected before each tool change
