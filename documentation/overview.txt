Toolpah System Overview:
	This document is an overview of the stages in the Miracle Grue pathing system. 

	This documents our system of converting an stl file and configuration file into
	a toolpath. This is designed to be suitable for 3D printers, but may be applied
	to other design -> toolpath systems in the future. 


Slicer:
	Module for converting an STL (or similar) file into a stack of 2D slices.  
	
	Input: STL file
	Output: Slicer output file .slices. 


Regioner:
	Module for converting a single slice file/object into a single region file/object.
	May need to know previous or next regions to operate

	Input: .slice file
	Output: .Region files

Pather: 
	Module for converting a region file containing 1 or more regions into a path file containing one or more paths for an 
	extrusion tool. 

	Input: .region file
	Output: .path file

Tooler:
	Module for combining a series of 2d path files into a fill 3D toolpath.  Subclasses of this may include
	gcode_tooler, or S3G_Tooler

	Input: A bunch of .path files
	Output: A single output tool file, depending on subclass it may be gcode, s3g
