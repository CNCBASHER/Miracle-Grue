The slicer module processes 3D geometry and provides slices on demand. 

The following 3D geometry formats are supported:
- STL ascii
- STL binary
- OBJ (Maya)

Instead of using a geometry file directly, the slicer can also load a file that contains  various annotations and a reference to the geometry. This is could include things like:
- which file is used for which "colour" or "material"
- volumes of higher density for infills (or infill types)
- volumes of thicker shell regions
- volumes where support should be omitted or reinforced
- manual path overrides
- â€¦

here's a sample json annotation file. It takes precedence over the model file, and contains:
 - the model name
 - a 3D file for each tool_head along with a suggested color.

'{"version":0.1, "model":{"two colour world": {"tool_head_1": {"color": "green", "file": "Land.stl"}, "tool_head_0": {"color": "blue", "file": "Water.stl"}}}}'
'


the slicer module also accepts the configuration file that defines:
- machine type
- plastic types
- layer height or growth type (coarse / fine, heavy / light)

Here's a json file definition that contains the version (of the config file format) and a layer height in mm.

'
{"layer_height": 0.35, "version": "0.1"}
