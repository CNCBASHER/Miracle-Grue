The slicer output are regions. The region file is json and its format is as follows:

- a version
- The middle z position of the region (in mm)
- The region thickness. 
- a list closed polygons (2d coordinates) that define the part outline(s)
- a list of closed polygons that define the support outline(s)
The 'inside' of the polygons is defined as whatever is on the right side of the path.

There is an implicit line between the last point of each outline and the first point (the end points are not duplicated, there are as many segments as there are points).

Here's an example: a region with 1 support poly and 1 part poly

'{"thickness": 0.4, "version":"0.1", "contours": {"support": [[[0, 20], [0, 30], [10, 30], [20, 30]]], "part": [[[0, 0], [10, 0], [10, 10], [10, 0]]]}, "height": 0.2}'






The slicer module processes 3D geometry and provides slices on demand. 

The following 2D geometry formats are used as slicer output:
- ..region.svg path files, in a folder, one per slice layer. 
- .region file.  A region file with all slices in one file, and one <svg> block per slice layer.

Along with outputting the 2d gemoetry files, the slices can also output settings and metadata. This can include warnings, hints for other processing, or cache/queue data for on-disk storage.  This is could include things like:
- which file is used for which "colour" or "material"
- volumes of higher density for infills (or infill types)
- volumes of thicker shell regions
- volumes where support should be omitted or reinforced
- manual path overrides
- cache files location for this set of slices
- warnings or error information for other steps in the process
- Layout Hints metadata for other steps in the engine.

Material Tag: 
A material tag for each material used in the file. For a single material build,  one tag is  sufficent.
Ex: <material name="A" type="ABS" color="black"/> 

Path Tag(s):
For each region, there is an 'svg path' entity indicating the outline of the region. The 'class' of these regions indicate the type of path they are to receive . The paths 'shell_outline', 'fill_outline' and 'slice_envelope' are the baseline paths.

Examples:
<path class="fill_outline" material="A" fill="blue" d="M79.506,25.120 L79.506,38.669 L76.129,40.020 L75.234,40.020 L74.680,40.573 L74.680,43.510 L75.234,44.063 L75.645,44.063 L75.645,56.387 ... Z">
