The slicer module processes 3D geometry and provides slices on demand. 

The following 2D geometry formats are used as slicer output:
- ..region.svg path files, in a folder, one per slice layer. 
- .region file.  A region file with all slices in one file, and one <svg> block per slice layer.

Along with outputting the 2d gemoetry files, the slices can also output settings and metadata. This can include warnings, hints for other processing, or cache/queue data for on-disk storage.  This is could include things like:
- which file is used for which "colour" or "material"
- volumes of higher density for infills (or infill types)
- volumes of thicker shell regions
- volumes where support should be omitted or reinforced
- manual path overrides
- cache files location for this set of slices
- warnings or error information for other steps in the process
- Layout Hints metadata for other steps in the engine.

Material Tag: 
A material tag for each material used in the file. For a single material build,  one tag is  sufficent.
Ex: <material name="A" type="ABS" color="black"/> 

Path Tag(s):
For each region, there is an 'svg path' entity indicating the outline of the region. The 'class' of these regions indicate the type of path they are to receive . The paths 'shell_outline', 'fill_outline' and 'slice_envelope' are the baseline paths.

Examples:
<path class="fill_outline" material="A" fill="blue" d="M79.506,25.120 L79.506,38.669 L76.129,40.020 L75.234,40.020 L74.680,40.573 L74.680,43.510 L75.234,44.063 L75.645,44.063 L75.645,56.387 ... Z">
