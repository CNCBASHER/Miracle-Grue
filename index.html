        <h3>Welcome to Miracle Grue (Beta)</h3>

<p>We at MakerBot have lost entire lifetimes waiting for things to slice.  It's like being eaten by a Grue, but slowly. Several times a day. Every day.</p>

<p>To save our own lives and sanity, we are creating a new slicing engine.  It will never be perfect, it will never be closed source, and it will always be fast.</p>

<p>Miracle-Grue is a slicing tool for turning STL and OBJ files into GCode toolpaths. It is designed to be used as part of a larger software package, but we are also making it available as a command line tool.</p>

<h3>How to Get Started Using Miracle-Grue</h3>

<p>If you want to use Miracle-Grue, you can download the binaries from  and install them on your computer.  From there you can use the command line to slice your 3D files into GCode toolpaths. </p>

<h3>How to Get Started Hacking Miracle-Grue</h3>

<h4>Pre Reqs</h4>

<p>First you'll need to install QTCreator (or the QTSDK, if you're ambitious) on your favorite OS. </p>

<p>Then clone Miracle-Grue, using recursive cloning, to your local machine. That will look like this: 'git clone --recursive <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:makerbot/miracle-grue.git' Then simply open miracle-grue.pro in QTCreator and build it.  So simple! Unless you forget the --recursive, in which case you will need to get the submodules imported correctly on your own.</p>

<p>We also have a simple test UI for debugging and testing. You can find it in the project file miracle-gui.pro.  It's for engineering use only, so don't expect it to be amazing (or bug-free). </p>
