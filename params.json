{"name":"Miracle-Grue (Beta)","body":"### Welcome to Miracle Grue (Beta)\r\nWe at MakerBot have lost entire lifetimes waiting for things to slice.  It's like being eaten by a Grue, but slowly. Several times a day. Every day.\r\n\r\nTo save our own lives and sanity, we are creating a new slicing engine.  It will never be perfect, it will never be closed source, and it will always be fast.\r\n\r\nMiracle-Grue is a slicing tool for turning STL and OBJ files into GCode toolpaths. It is designed to be used as part of a larger software package, but we are also making it available as a command line tool.\r\n\r\n### How to Get Started Using Miracle-Grue\r\nIf you want to use Miracle-Grue, you can download the binaries from <TBD> and install them on your computer.  From there you can use the command line to slice your 3D files into GCode toolpaths. \r\n\r\n### How to Get Started Hacking Miracle-Grue\r\n#### Pre Reqs\r\nFirst you'll need to install QTCreator (or the QTSDK, if you're ambitious) on your favorite OS. \r\n\r\nThen clone Miracle-Grue, using recursive cloning, to your local machine. That will look like this: 'git clone --recursive git@github.com:makerbot/miracle-grue.git' Then simply open miracle-grue.pro in QTCreator and build it.  So simple! Unless you forget the --recursive, in which case you will need to get the submodules imported correctly on your own.\r\n\r\nWe also have a simple test UI for debugging and testing. You can find it in the project file miracle-gui.pro.  It's for engineering use only, so don't expect it to be amazing (or bug-free). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIf you want to contact us, or suggest bugfixes, features, or other tasks, please join our [https://groups.google.com/group/miracle-grue-dev](developers mailing list).
